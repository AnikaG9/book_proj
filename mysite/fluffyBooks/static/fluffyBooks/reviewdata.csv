Harry Potter,This book was such a whimsical book with so many ups and downs,mainanika
Things we never said,A heartbreaking story that had me on the edge of my seat. It had the perfect balance any good book should have of comedy,laughter and some touches of real life hardship. A must read!,fakeanika
